# Amplifier Advisory Committee - Constitution

## Preamble
This Constitution establishes the Amplifier Advisory Committee (the “Committee") whose aim is to assist the Axelar network community in connection with maintaining the integrity, security, and efficiency of integrations with the protocol connected to the Axelar network known as “Amplifier.”  This document serves as the foundational governance framework for the Committee's charter and operations.  Though it is not mandatory for an interested Amplifier integration to submit a Proposal to the Committee, it is highly recommended that such Proposal is submitted.

## Article I: Purpose

The purpose of the Committee is to review and assess security measures associated with proposals submitted by teams working on protocols that desire to integrate with Amplifier (each such submission a “Proposal”) and thereby engage with the broader Axelar network community to promote best security practices.  Integration of protocols into Amplifier is outside the scope of this Constitution, and is subject to a Network Governance Vote (as defined below).

## Article II: The Committee

### Section 1: Committee Composition
The Committee shall consist of members who are recognized experts in areas relevant to blockchain security, such as cybersecurity, blockchain architecture, and risk assessment (each a “Member,” collectively the “Members”).

### Section 2: Instantiation and Membership Term
This Constitution, and the cohort of initial Members, will be instantiated subject to a decentralized governance vote by a majority of Axelar network token holders (a “Network Governance Vote”).  The initial term for the Members will be one (1) year from the date of such vote.  Thereafter, each Member’s term shall automatically renew for additional one (1) year periods, provided a Network Governance Vote may take place to remove a Member from the Committee, with such removal becoming effective as of the last day of the then current period.

### Section 3: Resignation and Replacement
To the extent that a Member desires to resign from the Committee, such Member shall provide at least ninety (90) days prior notice to the other Members.  If a third party entity or individual desires to replace such resigning Member, then such entity or individual shall submit a proposal to the Axelar network community to be voted upon via a Network Governance Vote.

### Section 4: Compensation
Each Member shall be compensated in such amount of funds as agreed upon by the Committee, and the source and means of such compensation may be updated by the Committee from time to time. 

## Article III: Committee Responsibilities

### Section 1: Proposal Evaluation 
Each Member shall endeavor to engage in an evaluation of Proposals (“Evaluation”) so as to provide for a diverse range of insights and expertise. Committee shall collaborate to develop criteria to be used for purposes of the Evaluation.
 
### Section 2: Report
After an Evaluation is completed by the Committee, the Committee shall compile a comprehensive report summarizing the Evaluation findings and the Committee’s recommendations (if any) (the “Report”).  The Report shall be shared publicly to maintain transparency.  Each Report shall list the relative contributions of each Member.

### Section 3: Public Reporting
The Committee shall publish a summary of all of the Committee’s activities and Reports from time to time. 

### Section 4: Processes and Procedures
The Committee shall be responsible for abiding by those processes and procedures as set forth below, which may be updated from time to time (the “Processes and Procedures”).

## Article IV: Stakeholder Engagement

Feedback from the community on the activities of the Committee is actively sought. This feedback shall be used to refine and improve the Processes and Procedures, providing for them to remain fair, transparent, and aligned with the community’s expectations.

## Article V: Amendments

**Constitution**: Any amendments to this Constitution require approval by a Network Governance Vote.

**Processes and Procedures**: Any amendments to the Committee's Processes and Procedures may be made by the Committee from time to time, subject to the approval by a majority vote of the Committee.

## Article VI: Dissolution

The Committee may be dissolved by a Network Governance Vote. In such an event, any remaining assets received for purposes of compensation will be redirected as determined by a Network Governance Vote, with such vote focusing on enhancing network security or another community-directed initiative.

**Technological Assessment**: Examine the underlying technology of each connection, including advanced cryptographic techniques like light-clients or zero-knowledge proofs, to determine whether a solid security model is in place.

**Code Quality and Transparency**: Evaluate the quality of the code, its public availability, documentation, and results of independent audits to assess the reliability and maintainability of the connection.

**Deployment and Maintenance Plans**: Review the lifecycle of a connection, from initial deployment to ongoing maintenance, ensuring comprehensive plans exist for updates, bug fixes, and upgrades within the ecosystem.

### Section 3: Community Engagement

Committee shall engage with the Axelar network community to promote transparency, gather feedback, and facilitate an open dialogue regarding proposal evaluations and Reports.
