## Article III: Responsibilities and Duties

### Section 1: General Duties of the Committee

The Committee is tasked with maintaining the security integrity of the Axelar network by evaluating all proposals related to chain integrations and enhancements to the network's security framework. The Committee ensures all activities and decisions are well-documented, transparent, and reflect the interests of the Axelar community.

### Section 2: Unified Responsibilities

To ensure comprehensive coverage and expertise in handling the complexities of the network, all Committee members share the following responsibilities:

- **Security Evaluation: Criteria and Process**:
    - **Validator Set Scrutiny**: Assess the size and decentralization of validator sets for connections relying on external validation models. Provide guidance to ensure robust validator sets that utilize economic or non-economic security mechanisms for sufficient decentralization.
    - **Technological Assessment**: Examine the underlying technology of each connection, including advanced cryptographic techniques like light-clients or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure a solid security model is in place.
    - **Code Quality and Transparency**: Evaluate the quality of the code, its public availability, documentation, and results of independent audits to assess the reliability and maintainability of the connection.
    - **Deployment and Maintenance Plans**: Review the lifecycle of a connection, from initial deployment to ongoing maintenance, ensuring comprehensive plans for updates, bug fixes, and upgrades within the ecosystem.
- **Community Engagement**:
    - Engage with the Axelar community to promote transparency, gather feedback, and facilitate an open dialogue regarding proposal evaluations and Committee decisions. This also involves representing the Committee in community discussions and forums.

Additionally, some Committee members may take on specialized responsibilities in operational management:

- **Operational Management**:
    - Oversee the coordination of Committee activities, ensuring that meetings are effectively facilitated, timelines are adhered to, and the governance framework is maintained. These members also manage the preparation and publication of detailed evaluation reports.
- **Financial Management**:
    - Manage financial mechanisms related to the review of proposals, including the oversight of the security incentive pool and distribution of funds. This responsibility ensures financial transactions are handled with transparency and accountability.

## Article IV: Committee Operational Procedures

### Section 1: Proposal Submission and Review

- Proposals are submitted with the necessary technical details via the community forum. There is no fee required for a proposal to be submitted to the Committee, but it is highly recommended that all proposals undergo a technical and security review by the Amplifier Advisory Committee. The entire Committee engages in the evaluation, ensuring a diverse range of insights and expertise influence the review process. Note that while there is no fee to submit to the Committee, there may be fees for on-chain proposals.

### Section 2: Feedback and Recommendations

- After thorough evaluation, the Committee compiles a comprehensive report summarizing the review outcomes. This report is shared publicly to maintain transparency and includes recommendations ranging from proceeding with modifications to requiring substantial revisions.

### Section 3: Community Decision-Making

- The wider community is invited to review the Committee's findings and participate in the final decision-making through structured voting mechanisms, ensuring that major network changes are democratically approved.

### Section 4: Regular Meetings and Communications

- Regular meetings are scheduled to discuss active and upcoming proposals, and meeting minutes are published to ensure transparency and community visibility.

## Article V: Governance

### Section 1: Decision-Making Process

- The Security Council is responsible for providing recommendations on whether a chain should be onboarded to the network, but it does not make the final decision.
- The decision-making process for adding a chain to the network is conducted through a vote by token holders.

## Article VI: Financial Provisions

### Section 1: Grants and Fund Management

- **Grants:** For proposals that opt into the review by the Amplifier Advisory Committee, the Committee will be compensated for their time and efforts with an AXL grant. This grant is based on the complexity of the project and ensures the Committee has the necessary resources to conduct a thorough and effective security and technical review of the chain integration.
- **Multisig Wallet Management**: A multisig wallet will be held by the Committee for the incentives to be sent to. The keys to this wallet are held by designated members of the Committee, chosen based on their roles and responsibilities. The configuration of the multisig wallet requires a predefined number of signatures to approve any transactions, ensuring collective decision-making and enhanced security.

### Section 2: Compensation and Distribution

- **Even Distribution of Grants**: Upon completion of a proposal review, the AXL grant will be distributed fairly among the Committee members who actively participated in the review process. This method ensures that all contributing members are fairly compensated for their effort and involvement.
- **Operational Transparency**: Distribution transactions require the approval of the designated key holders of the multisig wallet. Each transaction must be documented and justified in the Committee's records to maintain transparency.

### Section 3: Contribution Validation

- **Validation of Participation**: Before the distribution of fees, the participation of each Committee member in the review process is validated. This validation is based on documented contributions and involvement in the review, which are essential for qualifying for a fair distribution of the fees.
- **Record-Keeping**: Detailed records of each member's participation in the review processes are maintained. These records are used as a basis for fee distribution and are subject to audit to ensure compliance with the Committee’s operational standards.

## Article VI: Amendments

- **Process and Procedure Updates**: Updates related to the Committee's processes and procedures can be approved by a majority vote of the Committee members.
- **Constitutional and External Changes**: Any amendments to the Constitution or changes that extend beyond the Committee’s established processes and procedures require approval by a majority vote of token stakeholders.

## Article VII: Dissolution

- The Committee may be dissolved by a community vote if deemed necessary. In such an event, remaining assets will be redirected or utilized as determined by a majority community vote, focusing on enhancing network security or other community-directed initiatives.
