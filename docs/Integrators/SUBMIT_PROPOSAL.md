# Proposing a Chain

## Process for Proposers

1. **Chain integrators create a Proposal for a new chain.**
    - A template for the proposal with the key criteria to be assessed can be found [here](../src/chains/_TEMPLATE/PROPOSAL.md). Fork the repository and create a pull request with your proposal.
    - Proposals must include technical details, evaluation criteria, and relevant documentation.

2. **Once the pull request is merged, start a discussion in the [community](https://community.axelar.network/) with a link to the proposal to facilitate community discussion.**
    - Community members review and discuss the proposal. Proposers engage with the community to address questions and feedback. Chain Integrators should update the proposal to reflect community feedback and address concerns.

3. **Security Advisory Committee to initiate review.**
    - Chain Integrators are required to post a $[ ] bond in AXL-equivalent, to a multi-sig [wallet](../SECURITY_ADVISORY_COMMITTEE/SECURITY_ADVISORY_COMMITTEE.md#multisig-wallet) secured and managed by the Committee.
    - Chain Integrator must notify the Committee of the pledged amount (e.g., by submitting an Axelarscan link of the pledge).
    - The review will be posted in this GitHub repository in the same working directory as the chain's proposal, with a link posted to the community forum.
    - The bond will be released to the Committee for their review efforts according to this [mechanism](../SECURITY_ADVISORY_COMMITTEE/SECURITY_ADVISORY_COMMITTEE.md#compensation).

4. **Governance Proposals.**
    - With the security review underway, the Chain Integrator can put forward a governance proposal.
        - Governance proposal examples are available [here](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/amplifier/chain-integration/governance-proposals/).

5. **Ongoing Concerns.**
    - The chain's performance, underlying security, and overall activity will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the Committee.
