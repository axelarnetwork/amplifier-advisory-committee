# Proposing a Chain

## Process for Proposers

1. **Chain integrators create a Proposal for a new chain.**
    - A template for the proposal with the key criteria to be assessed can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/amplifier-advisory-committee/blob/feat/setup/src/chains/_TEMPLATE/PROPOSAL.md). Fork the repository and create a pull request with your proposal.
    - Proposals must include technical details, evaluation criteria, and relevant documentation.

2. **Once the pull request is merged, start a discussion in the [community](https://community.axelar.network/) with a link to the proposal to facilitate community discussion.**
    - Community members review and discuss the proposal. Proposers engage with the community to address questions and feedback. Chain Integrators should update the proposal to reflect community feedback and address concerns.

3. **Amplifier Advisory Committee to initiate review.**
    - The Amplifier Advisorsy Committee will review the chain proposal and provide a comprehensive and publicly available report ("The Report").
    - **The Report** will be posted in this GitHub repository in the same working directory as the chain's proposal, with a link posted to the community forum.
 
4. **Governance Proposals.**
    - With the Amplifier Advisory Committee review underway, the Chain Integrator can put forward a governance proposal.
        - Governance proposal examples are available [here](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/amplifier/chain-integration/governance-proposals/). It is strongly recommended that integrators wait to submit their governance proposal until the Committeeâ€™s report is ready, with the report being published first or simultaneously, allowing the community ample time to review the security and technical information before voting.

5. **Ongoing Concerns.**
    - The chain's performance, underlying security, and overall activity will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the Committee.
