## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technological Assessment:** The committee examines the underlying technology of each connection, including the use of advanced cryptographic techniques like light-clients or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure a solid security model is in place.

- **Code Quality and Transparency:** The quality of the code, its public availability, documentation, and the results of independent audits are all crucial factors in the evaluation process. These elements help assess the reliability and maintainability of the connection.

- **Deployment and Maintenance Plans:** The lifecycle of a connection, from its initial deployment to ongoing maintenance, is reviewed to ensure there is a comprehensive plan for addressing updates, bugs, and upgrades within the ecosystem.

## Key Areas to Monitor for Security Standards

To maintain the security and integrity of the Axelar network, it is essential to continuously monitor various components and aspects of integrated chains. Here are the key areas that need to be monitored for security standards:

### 1. **Validator Set Health**

- **Decentralization and Distribution**: Regularly assess the distribution of validators to ensure that no single entity controls a significant portion of the network, which could lead to centralization risks.
- **Validator Performance**: Monitor validator uptime, response times, and overall performance to ensure that the network remains robust and resilient.
- **Validator Stake Requirements**: Check that validators maintain the required minimum stake to ensure economic security.

### 2. **Smart Contract Security**

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuously scan deployed smart contracts for known vulnerabilities and ensure that any discovered issues are addressed promptly.
- **Code Changes and Upgrades**: Monitor any changes or upgrades to smart contracts to ensure that new code adheres to security best practices and does not introduce new risks.
- **Audit Follow-ups**: Ensure that all recommendations from security audits are implemented and track any follow-up audits to confirm compliance.

### 3. **Network and Protocol Integrity**

- **Cryptographic Protocols**: Regularly review the implementation and usage of cryptographic protocols (e.g., ZKPs, light clients) to ensure they remain secure against emerging threats.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Monitor the performance and security of the consensus mechanism, including any updates or changes that could impact the network's stability.
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Ensure that cross-chain communication mechanisms (e.g., relayers, gateways) are functioning securely and that there are no vulnerabilities in the message-passing process.

### 4. **Governance and Compliance**

- **Decentralized Governance**: Monitor the governance process to ensure that it remains decentralized and that decisions are made transparently and in the best interests of the community.
- **Compliance with Network Policies**: Regularly check that all integrated chains comply with Axelar's security policies, including those related to validator operations, smart contract standards, and network upgrades.

### 5. **Operational Security**

- **Incident Response**: Ensure that there is a robust incident response plan in place, and monitor the effectiveness of this plan through regular drills and real-time responses to security incidents.
- **Key Management**: Monitor the security of private keys used in critical operations, including validator keys, multisig wallet keys, and any other cryptographic keys essential to network security.
- **Access Control**: Regularly review and update access control policies to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to critical network components and administrative functions.

### 6. **Deployment and Maintenance Plans**

- **Regular Updates**: Monitor the deployment of updates and patches to ensure that all integrated chains are running the latest and most secure versions of their software.
- **Bug Tracking and Resolution**: Track reported bugs and vulnerabilities, ensuring they are resolved in a timely manner and that resolutions do not introduce new risks.
- **Upgrade Procedures**: Monitor the upgrade process for compliance with best practices, ensuring that upgrades are thoroughly tested before being deployed to the main network.

### 7. **External Threats and Attack Vectors**

- **DDoS and Network Attacks**: Monitor the network for signs of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or other network-based threats, ensuring that appropriate defenses are in place.
- **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Monitor for phishing attempts or social engineering attacks targeting validators, developers, or community members.
- **Emerging Threats**: Stay informed about new and emerging threats in the blockchain space, adjusting security practices and monitoring protocols as needed to address these risks.
