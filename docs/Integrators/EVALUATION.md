- **Consensus Mechanism**: Monitor the performance and security of the consensus mechanism, including any updates or changes that could impact the network's stability.
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Ensure that cross-chain communication mechanisms (e.g., relayers, gateways) are functioning securely and that there are no vulnerabilities in the message-passing process.

### 4. **Governance and Compliance**

- **Decentralized Governance**: Monitor the governance process to ensure that it remains decentralized and that decisions are made transparently and in the best interests of the community.
- **Compliance with Network Policies**: Regularly check that all integrated chains comply with Axelar's security policies, including those related to validator operations, smart contract standards, and network upgrades.

### 5. **Operational Security**

- **Incident Response**: Ensure that there is a robust incident response plan in place, and monitor the effectiveness of this plan through regular drills and real-time responses to security incidents.
- **Key Management**: Monitor the security of private keys used in critical operations, including validator keys, multisig wallet keys, and any other cryptographic keys essential to network security.
- **Access Control**: Regularly review and update access control policies to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to critical network components and administrative functions.

### 6. **Deployment and Maintenance Plans**

- **Regular Updates**: Monitor the deployment of updates and patches to ensure that all integrated chains are running the latest and most secure versions of their software.
- **Bug Tracking and Resolution**: Track reported bugs and vulnerabilities, ensuring they are resolved in a timely manner and that resolutions do not introduce new risks.
- **Upgrade Procedures**: Monitor the upgrade process for compliance with best practices, ensuring that upgrades are thoroughly tested before being deployed to the main network.

### 7. **External Threats and Attack Vectors**

- **DDoS and Network Attacks**: Monitor the network for signs of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or other network-based threats, ensuring that appropriate defenses are in place.
- **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Monitor for phishing attempts or social engineering attacks targeting validators, developers, or community members.
- **Emerging Threats**: Stay informed about new and emerging threats in the blockchain space, adjusting security practices and monitoring protocols as needed to address these risks.
