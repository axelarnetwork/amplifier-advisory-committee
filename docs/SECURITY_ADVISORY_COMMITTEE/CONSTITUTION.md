### Section 2: Unified Responsibilities

To ensure comprehensive coverage and expertise in handling the complexities of the network, all Council members share the following responsibilities:

- **Security Evaluation: Criteria and Process**:
    - **Validator Set Scrutiny**: Assess the size and decentralization of validator sets for connections relying on external validation models. Provide guidance to ensure robust validator sets that utilize economic or non-economic security mechanisms for sufficient decentralization.
    - **Technological Assessment**: Examine the underlying technology of each connection, including advanced cryptographic techniques like light-clients or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure a solid security model is in place.
    - **Code Quality and Transparency**: Evaluate the quality of the code, its public availability, documentation, and results of independent audits to assess the reliability and maintainability of the connection.
    - **Deployment and Maintenance Plans**: Review the lifecycle of a connection, from initial deployment to ongoing maintenance, ensuring comprehensive plans for updates, bug fixes, and upgrades within the ecosystem.
- **Community Engagement**:
    - Engage with the Axelar community to promote transparency, gather feedback, and facilitate an open dialogue regarding proposal evaluations and Council decisions. This also involves representing the Council in community discussions and forums.

Additionally, some Council members may take on specialized responsibilities in operational management:

## Article VI: Governance

### Section 1: Decision-Making Process

- The Security Council is responsible for providing recommendations on whether a chain should be onboarded to the network, but it does not make the final decision.
- The decision-making process for adding a chain to the network is conducted through a vote by token holders.

## Article VII: Financial Provisions

### Section 1: Grants and Fund Management

- **Grants:** For proposals that opt into the review by the Security Council, the Council will be compensated for their time and efforts with an AXL grant. This grant is based on the complexity of the project and ensures the Council has the necessary resources to conduct a thorough and effective security and technical review of the chain integration.
- **Multisig Wallet Management**: A multisig wallet will be held by the committee for the incentives to be sent to. The keys to this wallet are held by designated members of the Council, chosen based on their roles and responsibilities. The configuration of the multisig wallet requires a predefined number of signatures to approve any transactions, ensuring collective decision-making and enhanced security.

### Section 2: Compensation and Distribution

- **Even Distribution of Fees**: Upon completion of a proposal review, the incentives provided by the Axelar Foundation are distributed evenly among the Council members who actively participated in the review process. This method ensures that all contributing members are fairly compensated for their effort and involvement.
- **Operational Transparency**: Distribution transactions require the approval of the designated key holders of the multisig wallet. Each transaction must be documented and justified in the Council's records to maintain transparency.

### Section 3: Contribution Validation

- **Validation of Participation**: Before the distribution of fees, the participation of each Council member in the review process is validated. This validation is based on documented contributions and involvement in the review, which are essential for qualifying for an equal share of the fees.
- **Record-Keeping**: Detailed records of each member's participation in the review processes are maintained. These records are used as a basis for fee distribution and are subject to audit to ensure compliance with the Council's operational standards.

## Article VIII: Amendments

- **Constitutional and External Changes**: Any amendments to the Constitution or changes that extend beyond the Council’s established processes and procedures require approval by a majority vote of token stakeholders.

## Article IX: Dissolution
