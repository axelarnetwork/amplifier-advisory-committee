## **Section 1: Assessment Methodology**  

### **1.1 Integration Overview**  

The integration of **Stellar Soroban** with **Axelar** enables seamless cross-chain transactions and interoperability by leveraging Axelar's **General Message Passing (GMP)** and **security infrastructure**.  

This integration will allow Stellar developers to access liquidity pools, decentralized applications (dApps), and cross-chain functionalities within the broader Web3 ecosystem. As Stellar’s smart contract platform, Soroban introduces **WASM-based smart contracts** and **Stellar’s scalability framework**, making it a strong candidate for interchain expansion.  

### **1.2 Evaluation Approach**  

The **Amplifier Advisory Committee** conducted a **comprehensive assessment** of Stellar's integration, which included:  

- **Research and Documentation Review**: A detailed review of technical documentation, Stellar's GitHub repositories, and Axelar's Github repositories to understand the Stellar network’s capabilities and integration requirements.
- **Security Audits and Testing**: Examination of Stellar's codebase, previously conducted audits, and tests for vulnerabilities. This included reviewing best practices for wasm smart contracts.

### 1.3 Assessment Framework

The assessment framework focused on the following key areas:

- **Protocol Integrity**: 
- **Security Risks**: 
- **Operational Risks**: 
- **Compliance and Governance Risks**: 
- **Code Quality and Transparency**: 
- **Integration Plan**:

### 1.4 Assessment Criteria

The desirable properties related to Sui’s architecture and its integration with Axelar included:

- **Security**: 
- **Scalability and Performance**: 
- **Decentralization**: 
- **Governance**: 
- **Fault Tolerance**: 
- **Transparency**:
