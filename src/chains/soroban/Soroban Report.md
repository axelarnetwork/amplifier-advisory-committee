## **Section 1: Assessment Methodology**  

### **1.1 Integration Overview**  

The integration of **Stellar Soroban** with **Axelar** enables seamless cross-chain transactions and interoperability by leveraging Axelar's **General Message Passing (GMP)** and **security infrastructure**.  

This integration will allow Stellar developers to access liquidity pools, decentralized applications (dApps), and cross-chain functionalities within the broader Web3 ecosystem. As Stellar’s smart contract platform, Soroban introduces **WASM-based smart contracts** and **Stellar’s scalability framework**, making it a strong candidate for interchain expansion.  

### **1.2 Evaluation Approach**  

The **Amplifier Advisory Committee** conducted a **comprehensive assessment** of Stellar's integration, which included:  

- **Technical Documentation Review**: Examined Soroban’s developer documentation, smart contract execution model, and network specifications.  
- **Source Code Examination**: Reviewed relevant Stellar integration code for security, efficiency, and alignment with Axelar’s GMP framework.  
- **Security Audit Reports**: Assessed existing audit reports on Soroban’s execution environment, validator network, and known vulnerabilities.  
- **Risk Analysis**: Identified key risks related to Soroban’s smart contract execution, network reliability, and security considerations.  
- **Integration Testing**: Planned interoperability testing to validate Soroban’s compatibility with Axelar.  

The **Amplifier Advisory Committee** oversees and reviews the integration, ensuring it meets security and performance benchmarks. The committee plays a key role in approving technical milestones, deployment phases, and final mainnet readiness.  

#### **Approval Process**  
- The committee evaluates integration milestones before deployment.  
- A **majority vote** is required for **mainnet launch approval**.  
- Security audits and technical assessments must be completed before final approval.
