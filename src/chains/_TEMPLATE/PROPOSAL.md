### Request for Security Council Review

**Purpose of Review:**

To ensure that ExampleChain's integration with the Axelar network meets all security and technical standards, thereby guaranteeing a secure and efficient connection.

**Proposed AXL Grant:**

Based on the complexity of ExampleChain, we propose an AXL grant of 20,000 AXL tokens to compensate the Security Council for their time and efforts in conducting a thorough review.

**Scope of Review:**

- **Technological Assessment:** Evaluation of the protocol design and implementation, overall security practices
- **Code Quality and Transparency of the Axelar Integration Components:** QA of the intended design, implementation, and best practices followed for both the external and Amplifier contracts
- **Understanding of Deployment and Maintenance Plans:** Ensure there is a comprehensive plan for addressing updates, bugs, and upgrades
- **Consideration for Externalities:** Open-ended analysis of anything unique about the chain that the Committee thinks the community of voters should be aware of
