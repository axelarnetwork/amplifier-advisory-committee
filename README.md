# Amplifier Advisory Committee

The introduction of the Amplifier Advisory Committee marks a significant stride towards bolstering the security landscape of multi-chain development. 

This initiative is designed to establish a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of new proposed connections to the Axelar network, prioritizing security, decentralization, and reliability. 

This effort reflects a growing recognition within the blockchain community of the need for rigorous security standards to safeguard interconnected blockchain networks.

## [Proposal submission process](docs/Integrators/SUBMIT_PROPOSAL.md)
The chain integration process involves submitting a detailed proposal by forking the provided template and creating a pull request with technical details, evaluation criteria, and relevant documentation. Once the proposal is merged, proposers engage the community for discussion and feedback, updating the proposal as necessary. The Amplifier Advisory Committee will review the proposal and publish a public report, which should be available before or simultaneously with the submission of a governance proposal.
